## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely
helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or development
   branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create
   a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

4. **Use the bug report template** &mdash; please fill in the template which appears when you open a new
   issue.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as
detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What
browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help
people to fix any potential bugs.
